As elaborated by Einstein, Poincare, and Minkowski, general Relativity explains how masses, composed of mass and energy, curve the space, time and light. The most simplest illustration of this is the way that mass curves space. If you put a heavy ball in the middle of a sheet, it will bend the sheet around it. By doing so, it creates least-energy pathways around it. In a similar manner, the massiveness of the sun bends the space around it such that planets find the least-action path as elliptical paths around it" %}</p>
