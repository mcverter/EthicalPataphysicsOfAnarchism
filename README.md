# Empiricisme Radicale en Francais
Levinas est très conscient de sus mots; quelle choix est bien choisie.  

Il y a beaucoup de variables que je voudrais analysée
1. Connections internelle des racines des mots.  Pour exemple en le premiere livre, Levinas parle de "hypostasis" et "destitution". In le deuxième livre, il parle de "institution".  Le racine de tous ces mots est "STA", qui tient une histoire important en philosophie ("substance", "gestell", etc)
2. Connections sémantique / thématique / ontologique .  En son première livre Levinas parle de "paternité" et "fraternité".  En son deuxième livre il parle de "maternité".  Mais aussi il y a aucune references a "l'orpheline".  Cette "orpheline" est toujours toujours toujours en une état de "destitution".  Aussi il discute le technique de le philosophe Socrates comme une "maïeutique", le soignant donc
3. Le transformation de forme des mots.  Type de mot (verbe ou nom ou adjectif etc); conjugation, plural, gendre, etc.   

Je suis un computer programmer.  Je vais écrire une system avec Javascript et Postgres je pense, incluant le libraire npm de IEFFF.  Je peux écrire une interface pour utiliser en React/Redux et le server je pense node/express/knex/postgres.   J'ai déjà écrit cette projet vingt années en le passe avec PERL-cgi!!!

Maintenant, j'en ai besoin de rechercher que doit-je faire avec tout mes data.  Maintenant, j'ai fait deux choses

1.  Créer deux archives avec les mots de les deux livres de Levinas, sans footnotes ou endnotes ou titres ou sous titres
2. Développe une script de nodejs pour lire cette archives, et conter le frequencie de chaque mot.

...   ....   ...

3. En le future, je vais faire une recherche web pour chaque mot de ces morphologie, racine étymologique, signification sémantique etc.


Il faut qu'immédiatement que je control le data.  Maintenant j'en ai seulement le frecuencia de chaque mot.  Mais quelque mots apparaît en une forme verbale et aussie une forme nominale et aussie une forme adverbial ou adjectival.  Donc je voudrais conter deux choses ici:  (1) Le frequencie de la racine et (2) Le frequencie de chaque forme.


# Radical Empiricism in English
Rather than focusing on the obvious rhetorical gestures Levinas makes, a radical reading must look carefully at the immanent play of tropes within his work.  Levinas’s writing can only be understood through a close investigation of the interconnections and transformation between clusters of metaphors.  Derrida slyly indicates this problem when he explains that “everything which Levinas designates as ‘formal logic’ is contested in its root.  This root would not only be the root of our language, but the root of all western philosophy” (WD 91).

Derrida’s hint suggests that the easiest place to begin looking at Levinas’s immanent wordplay would be in his etymological roots.  For example, the Indo-European root “STA” has a long tradition in philosophy.  Greek thought articulates it as “hypoSTAsis,” which is transformed into Latin as “subSTAntia.” In “The Origin of the Work of Art,” Heidegger considers this translation of philosophical terms to be one of the primordial stages in the forgetting of Being (BW 153). He redeploys this root using terms common to the German philosophical tradition such as “VerSTAnd” (understand), “GegenSTAnd” (represent) and “VorSTEllung” (notion), and he coins new terms such as “GeSTEll” (enframing) (BW 301).  Almost parodying Heidegger, Levinas retranslates this German lexicon back into a Latin tongue, “romancing” the words back into a Romance language.[8]  Not only does Levinas reclaim the term “hypostasis,” he transmutes this root into terms such as “deSTItution,” “subSTItution,” and “inSTItution.” 

Derrida warns against the temptations of etymological thinking (MP 210), so I would not make the strong claim that Levinas puts his faith in the French language the same way Heidegger considers German to be the “House of Being” (BW 193).  Whatever the ultimate ontological status of language, it seems clear that Levinas carefully picks each word in his texts with attention to its etymological and morphological resonances.  In the 1940s, Levinas displays this extraordinary attention to linguistic detail by noting that what Heidegger’s “being-in-the-world,” “being-for-death,” and “being-with-Others” add to our philosophical knowledge “is that these prepositions – ‘in’, ‘for’, and ‘with’ are in the root of the verb ‘to be’ (as ‘ex’ is in the root of the verb ‘to exist’)” (Wahl  50).  Thus, we should assume that Levinas is always aware of roots, prefixes, and suffixes; of the nominal, verbal, prepositional, adjectival, and adverbial parts of speech; of the active, middle, and passive voices; of the nominative, vocative, dative, genitive, ablative, accusative and even locative cases.

In addition to these morphological considerations, we must attend to the semantic connections between various etymological networks.  For example, words rooted in “STA” (e.g. stand), must be correlated with other etymological networks connoting position and proximity, as well as those connoting height and depth.  The very word “origin” comes from oriri, to rise:  for Levinas, man has “overcome” the “destitution” of his “animal needs” (TI 116-17) to become homo erectus, already erect and masterful and virile.

# Ethical 'Pataphysics of Anarchism
## A guide for exceptional guttersnipes (Traité du savoir-vivre à l'usage des guttersnipes exceptionelles)

## PRIMARY CLAIMS
1. The standard interpretation of Levinas as a moralist is inaccurate and falls easy prey to the Nietzshean accusation that “we are lied to by morality.”
2. Contemporary anarchism has relied too much on militaristic language and concepts, especially those inherited from a lineage stretching from Heraclitus through Nietzsche and on to Deleuze. It would be enriched by adopting the ethical insights of Levinas and Kropotkin 


## ABSTRACT
In this work, I intend to propose a revised reading of Levinas and a revised model for anarchism, by reading his thought in conversation with his typical interlocutors such as Heidegger (but, in this work we extend the conversation all the way back to Heraclitus and extend it through Nietzsche up to Deleuze/Foucault as well), and also bring Levinas and anarchism in dialogue with feminist thought, activist writings, the Mahayana Buddhism of Nagarjuna and later writers, and the absurdism of Alfred Jarry and the Juggalo movement.   Throughout the work, phenomenological existence is illustrated by the everydayness of “exceptional” events: for example, Levinasian self-continuity/disruption though time is illustrated by trying to find one’s belt and ethical responsibility is illustrated by the exigencies of texting and other forms of digital communication, and Buddhist meditation as one mode of ethical responsibility as a deferral of response.

The work begins by considering my own identity and the status of philosophical conversation as “critique” in general, and resolves to pursue inquiry without the usage of militaristic metaphors common to thought since the conception of the agora as the site of conversation and polemos as the foundation of Being.  After this, we propose to do a reading of Levinas through his usage of metaphors and defend this decision.  The first metaphor we encounter is Nietzsche’s description of Truth as an “army of metaphor” so we look again at the problem of militarism in thought and in being, which takes us to a conversation with Heraclitean polemos and Niezchean perspectivism-as-Will-to-Power, as well as those belonging to this lineage such as Heidegger and Deleuze/Foucault.  We then propose reading Levinas for his metaphors of the family, in direct contrast to writers such as Simon Critchley and Tina Charter who have objected to this language.  We explain that we are doing a heretical, ‘pataphysical (absurdist) reading of Levinas which perverts the meaning of what family is and what Levinas means by the copula of Being as copulation, the continuous engendering of genders.  We explore the importance of the “maternal” by reevaluating the Aristotelian conception of oikonomos, which takes us into a discussion of how the central question for political economy is consumption, not production, and that human needs should take priority over everything else.  We then include or exerpt two of my already-published papers: “The Anarchism of the Other Person” and “Undoing patriarchy, subverting politics: anarchism as a practice of care”.  The last chapters explores how Levinas intends “family” to signify “re-ligare”, the way that people are ethically bound to each other even before the emergence of the social or the political.  We discuss alternatives to the nuclear family, such as the Juggalo family and the Radical Faeries.  The last chapter discusses the significance of this for activism, drawing on my past work that reads Levinas alongside the situationists and Raoul Vaneigem, on Simon Critchley’s work in “Infinitely Demanding”, and on writings by Deva Woodly, Leah Lakshmi, and other activists.
