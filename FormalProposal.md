# OBJECTIVE:
============
Map the relationships within the lexicon of the French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas (EL) and trace the shifts in
vocabulary between his two major works Totality and Infinity (TI) and Otherwise than Being (OTB)

# HYPOTHESES:
============= 
(1)  EL's lexicon permutes a finite set of etymological roots that are important in the history of philosophy. The set
of permutations changes markedly between TI and OTB

## EXAMPLE:

* Etymological Root: STA (to stand)
* Usage in Philosophy: Substance (Spinoza), Gestell (Heidegger)

## TI:

* The ethical position of the Other in its ethcial demand is "destitution"
* The elemental enjoyment of the self becomes subjectivity through a process of "hypostasis"

## OTB:

* Levinas uses the term "substitution" to describe the process of becoming-a-subject, replacing the previous term "
  hypostasis"

## Both

* "Institution" is used to describe relationships among third parties.

(1a)  Within the lexicon, are connections between various sets of roots. These linkages remain consistent although there
are topological transformations, especially from TI to OTB.

(2)  EL's vocabulary is also organized into semantic sets.

# FAMILY

# TI

* One's ethical relationship to the future is "paternity"
* One's political relationships with others is "fraternity"

## OTB

* One's ethical burden is "maternity"

## OTHER

* Teaching is referred to as "maeiutics (midwifery)
* The "orphan" is an aspect of the "destitute" other mentioned above
* The "sister soul" appears in the erotic section of TI and as an element of substitution in OTB"

(3) Morphological shifts

* EL himself explicitly refers to distinctions repeatedly throughout his texts, most notably the verbal infinitive "Le
  Dire" (The Saying) amd the nominal substantive "Le dit" (The Said). Beyond this there are scattered explicit
  references to other word forms. His choice to use various parts of speech and conjugations is always deliberate.

# TOOLS

* I am a software engineer so I can write database, server, and front end code to display my results, and can write web
  crawlers to collect data and automate word analyses.
* So far all I have done is calculate the frequency of each individual term in the wo texts.

# CURRENT CHALLENGES

* I do not actually know what Mapping a Lexicon looks like. I have no models for this.
* I am looking for good tools for analysing the characteristics of each word
*
    * Etymology:  Several etymological dictionaries exist so I can write scripts to query them
*
    * Morphology:  I am not familiar with this field of study. I downloaded a tool called The Lefff (Lexique des Formes
      Fléchies du Français) but I do not actually know how to use it. I need to be able to keep track of the base form
      of the word and the particular variant of it.
*
    * Semantic Categorization: I have no idea how to automate this. I am hoping that I don't have to label each word
      manually, but I probably do. It would be nice if there was an easy way to add tags.
