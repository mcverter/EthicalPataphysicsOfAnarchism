"Already in his earliest published works, Levinas displays extraordinary "
"attention to linguistic morphemes and their metaphorical dimensions. In his "
"1932 article that introduced Heidegger to the francophone world, Martin "
"Heidegger et l'ontologie, Levinas explains his decision to translate "
"Heidegger's term Zuhandenheit as maniabilite because he wishes to 'take this "
"term in its etymological sense' 35, preserving the root's reference to the "
"hand. In a conversation shortly after the end of the second world war, "
"Levinas explicitly reflects upon the importance of morphemes in Heidegger's "
"thought, explaining that what Heidegger's linguistic constructions Being-in-"
"the-world, Being-towards-death, and Being-with add to our philosophical "
"awareness 'is that these prepositions 'in', 'for', and 'with' are in the "

"typically consider this as a single genre of twenty rather than thinking the "

"Before I produce this woman before you, let me begin by suggesting that, in "

"that which would have reigned had the world never been created' (TI 231, my "
"italics). Two important things must be said about this dramatic person who "
"opposes origination. First of all, he is warned by the witches--the Moirae, "
"the Fates--that his death will come at the hands of an Other who is 'not of "
"woman born,' his friend MacDuff. Second, in order to understand who Macbeth "
"himself is, we must understand that 'Mac' is a common Gaelic prefix for 'son "
"of.' 'MacBeth' is quite an unusual name because generally these names are "
"patronymic, such as 'Johnson' for the son of John or 'MacDonald' for the son "
"of Donald, but in this case it would appear that this familiar character is "
