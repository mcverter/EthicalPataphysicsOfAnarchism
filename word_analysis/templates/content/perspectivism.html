Levinas’s work from the 40s demonstrates the tension of countervailing dimensions. The birth of subjectivity in hypostasis occurs simultaneously as a height and a depth, two opposing movements that describe the same event from diametrically reversed perspectives. As Levinas develops his account of the interaction between the self and the other person, he expands the idea – already implied in previous work – that the twofold dynamic of opposition can also be understood as a fourfold turning. The conversation with the other person delineates a set of perspectival conversions" %}.

Levinas’s usage of the superlative adverb most and suffix “–est determined by this perspective as are his employment of prefixes such as ex– and sur– to describe, for example, how the other person exceeds or surpasses as an “absolute surplus”. The Other’s height is articulated through correlate attributes such as mastery, which is manifested in a variety of ways, for example as the one who commands “you shall not commit murder” and who teaches the lesson of his exteriority to consciousness. This mastery can also exhibit malevolence as the “transcendence of the antagonist” who threatens me with death that “comes from the other as a tyranny”." %}</p>

Within Totality and Infinity, Levinas mentions this aspect when he describes the nascent self relating to the environmental element as “a wave that engulfs and submerges and drowns”. Levinas intensifies this analysis in Otherwise than Being by applying to subjectivity vivid metaphors of material poverty; for example, as a “denuding beyond the skin, to the wounds one dies from, denuding to death, being as a vulnerability”." %}</p>
