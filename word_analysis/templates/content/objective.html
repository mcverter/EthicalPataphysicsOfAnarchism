How does polarity function in Levinas's text? Too much secondary literature expresses a one-dimensional understanding of these dynamics, a line connecting two antagonistic poles: ontology contra ethics, totality contra infinity, paternity contra maternity. Such antagonistic analyses often lead to bellicose declarations, such as Jean-François Lyotard's description of “the hatred of the neutral constantly evinced by Levinas” or the unrelenting violence of RA Cohen who murderously declares that “Levinas cannot live with either Hegel or Derrida” and so on. " %}</p>
        <p class="card-text">{% trans "This misunderstanding of polar opposition also affects many earnest attempts to understand Levinas as well.

        <p class="card-text">{% trans "However, such a reading of polarity in Levinas as hatred or murder or privilege mistakenly introduces the idea of rank into opposition. But the idea of rank is precisely what Levinas challenges in his Preface to Totality and Infinity, arguing against both Heraclitus's Fragment 53 that declares Being and knowledge emerge as war, a struggle that determines the ranking of beings into masters and slaves, as well as Nietzsche's adaptation of Heraclitus in his refutatoin of morality with a Will to Power which derives initially from the “pathos of distance” that ranks the strong against the weak." %}</p>

But this narrative is laid out as a story of Genesis, borrowing motifs taken from the the Bible and the Greeks and thus tells a coming-of-age story as a series of steps that conform to these patriarchal mythologies. This story describes how one is born into a womblike or infantile elemental state, oceanic and womblike, then recollects himself as an individual by marrying himself to a woman and positioning himself in a house, from which he performs the activity of labor that produces works and wastes, objects that are alienated from him until he as he ages and deterioirates, drifiging drifts off towards a the unfathomable not-yet of death.

Let's call this provisional GS “VERTICAL”. But then we notice right away that the “vertical” can be opposed to the “horizontal”, a word that connotes the phenomenological concept of the horizon as the plane upon which a something given as a manifestation can be understood. Furthermore, all themes can be encompassed in the another provisional GS, DIMENSION. To this GS we can also add the Cartesian dimension of measure, extension." %}</p>
                <p class="card-text">{% trans "What would the word “dimension” have meant for Levinas? Two of Levinas's primary intellectual influences, Henri Bergson and Edmund Husserl, were both mathematicians and philosophers, whose early thinking had been shaped by considerations of the idea of a manifold taken from the non-Euclidean analytic geometry of Bernhard Reimann. Additionally, Levinas would most likely have read books such as Leon Brunschvicg's 1912 book Les etapes de la philosophie mathematique that whose final chapters are “Le probleme des dimensions”and “La position du probleme non euclidien”.

                <p class="card-text">{% trans "Levinas's knowledge of non-euclidean geometry is exposed most prominently in his usage of the word “curvature”, a term whose provenance is the non-Euclidean geometry of Reimann, Gauss, and others; and by extension in the theories of spacetime articulated by Albert Einstein's theories of general and special relativity.

                <p class="card-text">{% trans "On first glance, it may seem like Levinas is saying that Levinas is saying that the Height of the Other is the cause of curvature. But that is because we are reading too quickly and failing to recognize the polar inversion already located in the phrase: “La dimension de hauteur où se place Autrui”. The intervening “ou se place” already discusses location and the establishment of oneself at a particular point in space and in time, in the refexive self-placement. From “Time and the Other”, we know this self-positing dynamic as hypostasis, which doubles the me with the self, spiritual height with material weight, material gravity" %}</p>
                <p class="card-text">{% trans "It should be further noted that Levinas seems to shift his metaphors between books. Whereas Totaltiy and Infinity treats of the Infinite as a maximal value, Otherwise than Being instead considers the infinitesimal spaces that disrupt continuity. Otherwise than Being also emphasizes the notion of quantum idea of standing waves -- that waves interrupt and intersect themselves to form stable forms. However, all of these discussions can be traced back to earlier discussions in Totality and Infinity. and terminology from topology such as “node”, “knot”, “fold”, “plot”. " %}</p>
