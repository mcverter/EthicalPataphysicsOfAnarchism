        <h4 class="card-title">Doubler </h4>

     <div class="card-text">Levinas structures his thinking in doubles. He refers to this
                            continuously,
                            in discussions of ambguity, ambphibology, contradictions, paradoxes, and so on.
                        </div>
                        <div class="card-text">The importance of doubling should be understood in light of the
                            misunderstood slogan "ethics is first philosophy."
                            Rather than urging us to embrace the rank of priority, Levinas invites us to question
                            the priority of priority, to understand
                            how priority is always secondary to the relationship to a second party. The second party
                            is the other, who is also a singularity, but placed
                            in a position of juxtapostion or proximity or seriality

                        <div class="card-text">It should be noted that the number two has special significance in
                            Judaism. Books of Talmud
                            always open on the second page. The first book of creation, Genesis, starts with the
                            word B'RAISHIT. The root of the word
                            "ROSH" means the head or the first. The prefix "B'" means the number two, as well as
                            noun home, as well as the locative relation "inside".
                            The most popular female name in the bible is, in fact, "Beth" as in "Bethlehem"

                        <div class="card-text">It should also be noted that the Shakespearean hero "Macbeth" can be
                            broken
                            into the patronym "Mac" and the feminine "Beth", meaning perhaps breath or life or house
