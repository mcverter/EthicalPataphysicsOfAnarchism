    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Two common patterns are often employed in the secondary literature to try to navigate their way past this abyss.  The first is to seek out, among the twists and turns of language, those statements which are relatively straightforward, that are simple ontological statements connecting a subject with a predicate through the verb 'is'.  The most popular of these slogans is 'Ethics is First Philosophy'.  But not only does Levinas never use this exact expression, it misunderstands what the word 'first' means for Levinas.   To suggest, as does the first line of the entry on Levinas in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, that 'Emmanuel Levinas’ intellectual project was to develop a first philosophy' is to make it seem that Levinas's goal is to be first, to somehow win the competition for the smartest and most righteous philosopher of all time.  Although Levinas certainly is playing with the idea of firstness expressed in  Aristotle’s <em>prote philosophia</em> and Descartes’ <em>prima philosophia</em> and Heidegger's <em>primordial</em> thinking, the overall message of his Levinas's is that unity depends upon nullity, duality, tertiaty, and infinity.  For example, the first-person position of subjectivity is already conditioned by the second person position of the interlocutor as well as the third-person plane of generality, by the zero of anonymity and the infinity of sociality.  One can only appreciate the phrase 'first philosophy' through questioning the priority of priority, by recognizing that the first principle archē is already disturbed by the anarchy of these numerous relationships.  All of these numeric terms belong to the MATHEMATICS GS" %}</p>

    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Two other such slogans that are often misunderstood as the core of Levinas's thought are 'The Other is Most High' and Levinas's citation of the sixth Biblical commandment 'Thou kill shalt not kill'.  The key words in these phrases also depend on their relations with other members of their respective GS" %}</p>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "A proper understand the motif of 'height' requires an investigation of its relation with other terms that are members of the GEOMETRY GS, such as its reciprocal 'depth' as well as to the various geometrical terms such as 'curvature' and 'dimension', and corresponding terms coming from various subfields of mathematics and physics." %}</p>
