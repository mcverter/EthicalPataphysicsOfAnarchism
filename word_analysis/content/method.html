    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Once we start compiling these Genre Sets, we begin to notice that they contain words that are transformations of each other.  Most prominently, Levinas articulates his analyses through sets of thematic polar terms: birth and death, height and depth, self and other, interiority and exteriority, and so on.  The elliptical function defined by these two points magnetize a field of curvature around them which reorients the relationships between the entities under discussion  -- for example, Self and Other.  That is, each section of Levinas's text describes a new perspective, a new set of ethical-phenomenological coordinates and orientations.  This perspectival reorientation is legible within his terminlogy as the application of specific transformations applied to the morphemes that constitute specific Genre Sets." %}</P>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Within <em>Totaltiy and Infinity</em>, this procession of perspectives between textual divisions can be understood as a section-by-section clockwise rotation shifted laterally forward in time." %}</P>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "<em>Otherwise than Being</em> utilizes the same etymological roots and thematic genres as <em>Totality and Infinity</em>.  Very few if any novel themes appear in the second text.  All of the strange words he uses in the text can be understood as transformations of the terms of the previous texts, as the subjection of the same Genre Sets to new curvatures and transformations, a process that reveals new ethical-phenomenological perspectives." %}</P>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "For example, the thematic of the 'home' appears under several different curvatures within the text of <em>Totality and Infinity</em>, as the feminine gesture of 'welcome' and as the self's subjective localization as a <em>chez soi</em>.  In <em>Otherwise than Being</em>, this thematic genre becomes twisted along several axes of rotation such that it manifests as the term 'hostage' to describe the Self's subjection to the Other." %}</P>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Because Otherwise than Being is a deliberately unsystematic text, it has been more difficult to characterize the transformations that occur from chapter to chapter. At least two gestures seem characteristic: first, many of the analyses flip the axes of rotation such that the movement proceed in a counterclockwise fashion. The overall trajectory of <em>Totality and Infinity</em> tracks the transformation from selfhood to otherness, whereas <em>Otherwise than Being</em> tracks the tranformation from otherness to selfhood from selfhood to otherness.  More significantly, Levinas considers the question of orientation from a new angle, complimenting the earlier study of curvature with a closer investigation of periodic wave-functions.  Two important notes must be made about this motif of wave-functions.  First of all, from a mathematical point of view, a wave-equation is an application of the notion of curvature.  Secondly, a careful reading of <em>Totality and Infinity</em> reveals several usage of the waveform motif; <em>Otherwise than Being</em> expands these analyses and focuses more closely on these wave-like properties." %}</p>
