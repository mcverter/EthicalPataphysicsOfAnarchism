    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Once we start compiling these Genre Sets, we begin to notice that they contain words within them that are transformations of each other.  Most prominently, Levinas articulates his analyses through sets of thematic polar terms: birth and death, height and depth, self and other, interiority and exteriority, and so on.  The elliptical function defined by these two points magnetize a field of curvature around them which reorients both the relationships between the entities under discussion (for example, self and other).  That is, each section of Levinas's text describes a new perspective, a new set of ethical-phenomenological coordinates and orientations.  This perspectival reorientation is reflected in his terminlogy as the application of specific transformations applied to the morphemes that constitute specific Genre Sets." %}</P>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Within Totaltiy and Infinity, this procession of perspectives between textual divisions can be understood as a section-by-section clockwise rotation shifted laterally forward in time." %}</P>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Otherwise than Being utilizes the same etymological roots and thematic genres as Totality and Infinity.  Very few if any novel themes appear in the second text.  Many of them can be directly as expansions of events that appeared as 'clandestine' in the first book.  All of the strange words he uses in the text can be understood as transformations of the terms of the previous texts, as the subjection of the same Genre Sets to new curvatures and transformations, a process that reveals new ethical-phenomenological perspectives." %}</P>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "For example, the thematic of the 'home' appears under several different curvatures within the text of <em>Totality and Infinity</em> both as the feminine gesture of 'welcome' and as the self's localization as its <em>chez soi</em>.  In <em>Otherwise than Being</em>, this thematic genre is twisted along several reflections such that it appears as the self becoming the 'hostage' for the other." %}</P>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Because Otherwise than Being is a deliberately unsystematic text, I have had a harder time characterizing the transformations that occur from chapter to chapter. At least two gestures seem characteristic: first, many of the analyses flip the axes of rotation such that the movement proceed in a counterclockwise fashion -- a motion from other to self rather than from self to other.  More significantly, Levinas considers the question of orientation from a new angle, complimenting the earlier study of curvature with a closer investigation of periodic wave-functions." %}</p>
