        {% trans "We will do so by sorting the words in Levinas's texts into Genre Sets (GS) which correspond to the thematics that he explores in his work -- such as GENESIS and GEOMETRY.  When we do so, we can better notice that, throughout his texts, the words contained in these Genre Sets transform in characteristic patterns." %}</p>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Most prominently, Levinas articulates his analyses through sets of thematic polar terms: self and other, interiority and exteriority, and so on.  This elliptical function defined by these two points magnetize a field of curvature around them.  THis reorient both the relationships between the entities under discussion (for example, self and other) as well as the terminological permutation of an etymologically-defined genre being used in that discussion. That is, each section of Levinas's text describes a new perspective, a new set of ethical-phenomenological coordinates and orientations.  This perspective is denoted verbally through the application of a different transformations of linguistic roots and morphemes." %}</P>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Within Totaltiy and Infinity, this procession of perspectives between textual divisions can be understood as a section-by-section clockwise rotation shifted laterally forward in time." %}</P>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Otherwise than Being utilizes the same etymoglocial roots and thematic genres as Totality and Infinity.  Very few if any novel themes appear in the second text.  Many of them can be directly as expansions of events that appeared as 'clandestine' in the first book.  All of the words he uses in the text can be understood as transformations of the terms of the previous nexts. By subjecting  can be understood as these same themes subject to new curvatures and transformations, thereby revealing new ethical-phenomenological perspectives." %}</P>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "For example, the thematic of the 'home' is curved within Totality and Infinity  both as the feminine gesture of 'welcome' and as the self's localization as its <em>chez soi</em>.  In Otherwise than Being, this thematic genre is twisted along several reflections such that it appears as the self becoming the 'hostage' for the other." %}</P>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Because Otherwise than Being is a deliberately unsystematic text, I have had a harder time characterizing the transformations that occur from chapter to chapter. At least two gestures seem characteristic: first, many of the analyses flip the axes of rotation such that the movement proceed in a counterclockwise fashion.  More significantly, Levinas considers the question of orientation from a new angle, complimenting the earlier study of curvature with a closer investigation of periodic sinusoidal waves." %}</p>
