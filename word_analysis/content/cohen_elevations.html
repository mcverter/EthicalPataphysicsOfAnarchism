        <p>{% trans "The center of Levinas’s constellations of metaphors text is often hard to pinpoint, and to identify one point as being most central produces an image distorted by the particular gravity of that focus: an upright stance of height and a straightforward relation can seem to elevate a right opinion, the orthodox source of truth. A better measurement of Levinas’s semantics, however, is the iterative recurrence of terms and their juxtaposition among others within semantic constellations. One calculates the meaning of the phrase Most High through understanding the dimensions of the superlative adverb and the vertical adjective." %}</p>
        <p>{% trans "Furthermore, Cohen wrongly characterizes Levinas as someone who issues perscriptive commands or moral maxims. Instead, what Levinas always attempts to do is to show how our relations with an individual others and social others are always embedded in every part of existence. That is, he attempts to demonstrate how all of our “so commonplace” experiences are already bent eccentrically by the moral curvature of otherness, already bent from the straight line of straightforwardness or the right angle of height." %}</p>
