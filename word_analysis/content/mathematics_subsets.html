Pythagoras taught the his famous theorem about right angle triangles around the same time." %}</p>

It develops a formal system of logic that enunciate a small set of axioms that will be taken to be self-evident and then derives a set of theorems that follow from these axioms." %}</p>

                    <p class="card-text">{% trans "This formalization of mathematics greatly influenced mathemetmatics of the 20th century as well as phenomenology. Hilbert propososed that mathematics was something that could broken down into a set of axioms and theorems.  Russell and Whitehead attempted to do ground arithmetic and all of mathematics in the axioms of set theory in their 'Principia Mathematica'. However, Godel demonstrated that any system of axioms is necessarily incomplete and that such attempts were doomed to failure. Husserl, a colleague of Hilbert's at GÃ¶ttingen University, was once a mathematician himself. THroughout his work he discusses 'formal logic' which can be understood as an adoption of Hilbert's notion of axiomitaztion. This sysemization was very influential on Derrdia, whose earliest formulations of what would come to known as 'deconstruciton' made explicit use of Godel's incompleteness theorem and whose first book was an introduction on Husserl's 'The Origin of Geometry', a meditation on Euclid." %}</p>
