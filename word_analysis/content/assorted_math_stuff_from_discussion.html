How do these two words function in the narrative described by Levinas.  The narrative plot line that circles through <em>Totality and Infinity</em> is one of genesis: the story of how, after a certain death, out of nothing, someone is born, lives and then dies, but is resurrected in a new birth.  But this narrative is laid out as a story of Genesis, borrowing motifs taken from the the Bible and the Greeks and thus tells a coming-of-age story as a series of steps that conform to these patriarchal mythologies. This story describes how one is born into a womb-like or infantile elemental state, oceanic and womblike, then recollects himself as an individual by marrying himself to a woman and positioning himself in a house, from which he performs the activity of labor that produces works and wastes, objects that are alienated from him until he as he ages and deteriorates, drifting drifts off towards a the unfathomable not-yet of death. Yet he is saved from death by intercourse with this same feminine, and becomes the father of a child who is resurrected as a brother among brothers. " %}</p>
