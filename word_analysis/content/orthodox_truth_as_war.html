Cohen shows against other readers of Emmanuel Levinas’s writing is unparalleled anywhere else in the literature.

    <p>{% trans "Anyone who has read Levinas, and has made their way through the dizzying intensity of its poetic and prophetic of metaphors can certainly appreciate Cohen’s sense of wonder. However, Cohen makes the dangerous move of proclaiming Levinas’s thought to be true. In doing so, Cohen fails to reflect upon how the concept of truth functions in the economy of Levinas’s writing: for Levinas, the phenomenological tradition, and post-Kantian thought in general, truth is not considered a transcendental or absolute property of a thing or an idea. Levinas makes clear that the truth is always relative result of the product of the social domain negotiated with others. That is, the 'infinite' for Levinas signifies the <em>social</em> domain, a sociality that is reflected in the individual Other. Just as the individual's individuality can challenge the social definition of them, the truth is radically open to the question of a skeptic." %}</p>
    <p>{% trans "Indeed it seems clear that Cohen is using the term true here not simply to express his devotion to Levinas, but also as a cudgel to put down the philosophy of Levinas’s contemporaries. Practically canonizing Levinas as a saint or prophet, such an orthodox interpretation verges on dogmatism. We can already hear in Cohen’s contempt for thinkers who are merely “<em>fascinating</em> or <em>provocative</em>” an effort to reduce the ethical height of Levinas’s phenomenological ethics to a belligerent morality of <em>ressentiment</em>." %}</p>
    <p>{% trans "When orthodox interpreters assert this limited viewpoint as dogmatic truth, it often indulges in violent attacks upon those whose interpretation would dare to question the thinking of Levinas. It asserts its uperiority as dogmatic truth and condemns any interpretation that might potentially subvert this authority." %}</p>
    <p>{% trans "Such violence seems especially shocking coming from those who idolize Levinas, who famously begins his first major work Totality and Infinity with the accusation that philosophy considers being and truth as reducible to war:" %}</p>

    <p>{% trans "The ideology of war determines the world in terms of rank, lordship and submission. In terms of philosophical discourse, this polemical thinking about thinking considers philosophy in terms of combat, as competition to demonstrate superiority. Throughout his declarations of combat, Cohen reiterates this obsession with rank and dominance, repeatedly attacking other ideas and terms and writers as enemies and sserting that Levinas is superior to all of them, that in the race to be the first philosophy, ethics is the winner." %}</p>
