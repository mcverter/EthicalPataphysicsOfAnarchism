How does polarity function in Levinas's text? Too much secondary literature expresses a one-dimensional understanding of these dynamics, a line connecting two antagonistic poles: ontology contra ethics, totality contra infinity, paternity contra maternity. Such antagonistic analyses often lead to bellicose declarations, such as Jean-François Lyotard's description of “the hatred of the neutral constantly evinced by Levinas” or the unrelenting violence of RA Cohen who murderously declares that “Levinas cannot live with either Hegel or Derrida” and so on.

For example, a myriad of papers and books have either supported or defended the idea that Levinas privileges the masculine over the feminine or that he intially privileges the paternal and then privileges the maternal, or some other such argument that asserts Levinas promotes one pole of a given opposition to the detriment of the other pole." %}</p>

            <p class="card-text">{% trans "However, such a reading of polarity in Levinas as hatred or murder or privilege mistakenly introduces the idea of rank into opposition. But the idea of rank is precisely what Levinas challenges in his Preface to <em>Totality and Infinity</em>, arguing against both Heraclitus's Fragment 53 that declares Being and knowledge emerge as war, a struggle that determines the ranking of beings into masters and slaves, as well as Nietzsche's adaptation of Heraclitus in his refutatation of morality with a Will to Power which derives initially from the “pathos of distance” that ranks the strong against the weak." %}</p>
