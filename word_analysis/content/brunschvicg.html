We don't exist in a world of perfectly straight spaces.  Streets run along curves up hills and down valleys.  The curvature of the earth itself affects the way we see things in the distance.

    <blockquote class="blockquote">{% trans " Although this conclusion is hard enough to conceive for rudimentary psychology to which the theory of faculties has generally used us, it is not difficult to recognize that it finds its confirmation in psychological observation. When we believe we are browsing a Euclidean right, we are fooled by a vulgar illusion; We never walked in a straight line, we rather followed the arc of a large circle on the earthly sphere. We have never seen Euclidian right; Any line that gives the eye an effective impression is a bundle of Euclidean lines. The unconscious process of the Spirit will therefore consist in seizing this gross and limited experience in building an ideal representation plan where everything happens as if the radius of the earthly sphere increased until it becomes infinite, as if the thickness From a visible right decreased until they become zero." %}</blockquote>
