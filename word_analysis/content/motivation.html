<p class="card-text">Perhaps the most egregious examples of such a worshipful reading can be found in the writings of Richard A Cohen.
    Cohen grounds his faith in his belief that Levinas can be understood through his usage of superlatives. He
    summarizes Levinas's thinking as an assertion of superlative altitude.
<blockquote class="blockquote">This is perhaps the central claim of all Levinas’s thought, about which his entire work revolves: the face
    of the other manifests and is manifest in a moral height which is the dimension of G-d, the revelation of G-d.
<</blockquote>
Cohen agressively wields this notion of rank and dominance thoughout his commentaries, repeatedly asserting not just its core imortance for the Levinas interpretation, but also using it to attack not just Levinas's philosohical interlocutors but other commentors who would dare question or criticize any aspect of Levinas's writing.

g, Cohen expresses this contrast with astonishing violence, arguing that Levinas’s “battle cry would be ‘Against evil, for the good!’”[ . Cohen, Ethics, p. 104.]  We must ask here whether such polemics express Levinas’s thinking or whether the distinction between “good” and “evil” evokes a different genealogy of morals.  Such a polemical cry reduces Levinas’s ethics to ressentiment.
Throughout his declarations of combat, Cohen reiterates this obsession with rank and dominance, repeatedly attacking other ideas and terms and writers as enemies and asserting that Levinas is superior to all of them, that in the race to be the first philosophy, ethics is the winner.
Another goal is to question the privilege of privilege. This is what drives me a bit nuts while reading the
secondary literature. It's the most common accusation throughout all the secondary literature, that Levinas
privileges infinity over totality or humans over animals or childbearing over sex and so on. My belief is that these
writers are working with a popularized understanding of Derrida's deconstruction without fully appreciating the way
that both he and Levinas undermine the idea of privege itself Similarly, Levinas's thought is often summarized in
the slogan "Ethics is First Philosophy". But that's misunderstanding of how cardinal numbers work in Levinas, as we
