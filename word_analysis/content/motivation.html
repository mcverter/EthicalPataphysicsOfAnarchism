<p>This investigation into the multiplicity of perspectives within Levinas's text is motivated out of a concern that too
    much of the secondary literature employs one-dimensional analyses of Levinas's work, an analysis which mistakenly
    reduces his thinking to hierarchical calculations of rank. This hierarchcal reading is widespread throughout both
    laudatory and critical readings of Levinas, and more generally within the much of the analytic literature. </p>
<p>The unhealthy degree of reverence with which Levinas has read been by his admirers read has long been criticized. In
    2004, Simon Critchely lamented</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
    Much of the work on Levinas tends to confine itself to exegesis, commentary, comparison with other</blockquote>
<p>Two years later, Samuel Moyn offered a similar assessment</p>
<blockquote>So much existing commentary on Levinas is offered with submissive piety</blockquote>
<p>Why does Levinas interpretation tend to attract such readings of his work?  What impels certain commntators to position themselves as submissive to his higher power? Much of the fault can be attributed to the seductiveness of Levinas's language: if one can manage to wend one's way through the contortions of verbiage, it is hard not to be enchanted by its strange poetry, hypnotised by its rhythm, mesmerized by its an various intensities and extremities.
 </p>
But, as anyone who has struggled through these texts would know, then a problem occurs:  how can one start to understand these texts that are so seductive yet so difficult to understand?

Before we present various options alongside our own solution, which is the mission of this project, we wish to
remark that Levinas deliberately writes cryptic prose. Throughout his analyses of manifold phenomenon, he reiterates the essentially 'hidden' or 'clandestine' aspect of that which is shown: we can know something from the outside as something known to us, but we can never completely know what that thing is from the inside.  No matter how much knowledge you accumulate about another person, it's impossible to ever really know what it's like to be that person. An object present its observable sides to us, but inso doing they hide its reverse.  Materiality itself presents itself as an obscurity.  We can understand matter in its forms and even the formal properties of matter but what matter is in itself has never been entirely clear: it's there but what is it?  Levinas approaches language in much the same fashion: simultaneusly presenting characteristics of an event while explaining that these same characteristics conceal something unpresentable.

Levinas deliberately
But then how does one understand a work which is deliberately hard to understand.
Levinas's works are deliberately dense .   He speaks repeatedly of the "opacity" and the "obsurity" and "clandestine" meanings that are always impoenatriable to understanding

<p>Perhaps the most egregious examples of such a worshipful reading can be found in the writings of Richard A Cohen.
    Cohen grounds his faith in his belief that Levinas can be understood through his usage of superlatives. He
    summarizes Levinas's thinking as an assertion of superlative altitude.
<blockquote>This is perhaps the central claim of all Levinas’s thought, about which his entire work revolves: the face
    of the other manifests and is manifest in a moral height which is the dimension of G-d, the revelation of G-d.
</blockquote>
Kanye agressively wields this notion of rank and dominance thoughout his commentaries, repeatedly asserting not just its core imortance for the Levinas interpretation, but also using it to attack not just Levinas's philosohical interlocutors but other commentors who would dare question or criticize any aspect of Levinas's writing.

He similarly characteries </p>

g, Cohen expresses this contrast with astonishing violence, arguing that Levinas’s “battle cry would be ‘Against evil, for the good!’”[ . Cohen, Ethics, p. 104.]  We must ask here whether such polemics express Levinas’s thinking or whether the distinction between “good” and “evil” evokes a different genealogy of morals.  Such a polemical cry reduces Levinas’s ethics to ressentiment.

Throughout his declarations of combat, Cohen reiterates this obsession with rank and dominance, repeatedly attacking other ideas and terms and writers as enemies and asserting that Levinas is superior to all of them, that in the race to be the first philosophy, ethics is the winner.


Another goal is to question the privilege of privilege. This is what drives me a bit nuts while reading the
secondary literature. It's the most common accusation throughout all the secondary literature, that Levinas
privileges infinity over totality or humans over animals or childbearing over sex and so on. My belief is that these
writers are working with a popularized understanding of Derrida's deconstruction without fully appreciating the way
that both he and Levinas undermine the idea of privege itself Similarly, Levinas's thought is often summarized in
the slogan "Ethics is First Philosophy". But that's misunderstanding of how cardinal numbers work in Levinas, as we


Such problems have characterized Levinas scholarship for a very long time

* Height and heirarchy. Other is the Most High
* Ethics is first philosphy: What does that mean?
* inability to move past his language
* inadequate exploration of his terms
* Overfocus on Heidegger Husserl Hegel
* patterns in sentences and sections and permutations
* ground rules: slow reading, look at each word. doubling correlate ords, roots, metonyms, historical, etymological
