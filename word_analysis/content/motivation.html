What impels certain commntators to position themselves as submissive to his higher power? Much of the fault can be attributed to the seductiveness of Levinas's language: if one can manage to wend one's way through the contortions of verbiage, it is hard not to be enchanted by its strange poetry, hypnotised by its rhythm, mesmerized by its an various intensities and extremities." %}
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "But, as anyone who has struggled through these texts would know, the reader confronts a serious problem: how can one start to understand these texts that are so seductive yet so difficult to understand?" %}
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Before we present certain types of tactics that many writers employ, we wish to remark that Levinas's prose is deliberately cryptic. Throughout his analyses of manifold phenomenon, he reiterates the essentially 'hidden' or 'clandestine' aspect of that which is shown: we can know something from the outside as something known to us, but we can never completely know what that thing is from the inside. No matter how much knowledge you accumulate about another person, it's impossible to ever really know what it's like to be that person. This abyss of the unknowable appears throughout philosopical inquiry, always lurkng behind notions such as objectivity, materiality, and generality.  An object present its observable sides to us, but in so doing they hide its reverse. Materiality itself presents itself as an obscurity. We can understand matter in its forms and even the formal properties of matter but what matter is in itself has never been entirely clear: it's there but what is it? One can understand a thing through generalities but never its individuality as such. Levinas approaches language in much the same fashion: simultaneusly presenting characteristics of an event while explaining that these same characteristics conceal something unpresentable." %}
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Two common patterns are often employed in the secondary literature to try to navigate their way past this abyss.  The first is to seek out, among the twists and turns of language, those statements which are relatively straightforward, that are simple ontological statements connecting a subject with a predicate through the verb 'is'.  The most popular of these slogans is 'Ethics is First Philosophy'.  But not only does Levinas never use this exact expression, it misunderstands what the word 'first' means for Levinas.   To suggest, as does the first line of the entry on Levinas in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, that 'Emmanuel Levinas’ intellectual project was to develop a first philosophy' is to make it seem that Levinas's goal is to be first, to somehow win the competition for the smartest and most righteous philosopher of all time.  Although Levinas certainly is playing with the idea of firstness expressed in  Aristotle’s <em>prote philosophia</em> and Descartes’ <em>prima philosophia</em> and Heidegger's <em>primordial</em> thinking, the overall message of his Levinas's is that unity depends upon nullity, duality, tertiaty, and infinity.  For example, the first-person position of subjectivity is already conditioned by the second person position of the interlocutor as well as the third-person plane of generality, by the zero of anonymity and the infinity of sociality.  One can only appreciate the phrase 'first philosophy' through questioning the priority of priority, by recognizing that the first principle archē is already disturbed by the anarchy of these numerous relationships." %}
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Two other such slogans that are often misunderstood as the core of Levinas's thought are 'The Other is Most High' and Levinas's citation of the sixth Biblical commandment 'Thou kill shalt not kill'.  Just as the meaning of the phrase 'first philosophy' depends upon a constellation of numeric terms (all members of the MATHEMATICS Genre Set)j, the key words in these phrases also depend on terms To properly understand the motif of 'height', one must interrogate its relation with other terms he uses, such as its polar opposite 'depth' as well as to the various geometrical terms such as 'curvature' and 'dimension', and corresponding terms coming from various subfields of mathematics and physics. To understand the motif of 'murder', one must similarly understand the entire narrative of continuous creation that Levinas unfolds from birth to childhood to marriage to laboring to old age to death to the generation of a new generation.  Levinas's announcement of the ethical prohibion on murder appears during the sectoin of the narrative that meditates on the meaning of death " %}

In practice, this often simply paraphrasing Levinas or using muddled phrasings and terms that attempt to simluate the well-constructed complexity of Levinas's own text." %}</p>

<p class="card-text">Perhaps the most egregious examples of such a worshipful reading can be found in the writings of Richard A Cohen.
    Cohen grounds his faith in his belief that Levinas can be understood through his usage of superlatives. He
    summarizes Levinas's thinking as an assertion of superlative altitude.
<blockquote class="blockquote">This is perhaps the central claim of all Levinas’s thought, about which his entire work revolves: the face
    of the other manifests and is manifest in a moral height which is the dimension of G-d, the revelation of G-d.
<</blockquote>
Cohen agressively wields this notion of rank and dominance thoughout his commentaries, repeatedly asserting not just its core imortance for the Levinas interpretation, but also using it to attack not just Levinas's philosohical interlocutors but other commentors who would dare question or criticize any aspect of Levinas's writing.

He similarly characteries </p>

g, Cohen expresses this contrast with astonishing violence, arguing that Levinas’s “battle cry would be ‘Against evil, for the good!’”[ . Cohen, Ethics, p. 104.]  We must ask here whether such polemics express Levinas’s thinking or whether the distinction between “good” and “evil” evokes a different genealogy of morals.  Such a polemical cry reduces Levinas’s ethics to ressentiment.

Throughout his declarations of combat, Cohen reiterates this obsession with rank and dominance, repeatedly attacking other ideas and terms and writers as enemies and asserting that Levinas is superior to all of them, that in the race to be the first philosophy, ethics is the winner.


Another goal is to question the privilege of privilege. This is what drives me a bit nuts while reading the
secondary literature. It's the most common accusation throughout all the secondary literature, that Levinas
privileges infinity over totality or humans over animals or childbearing over sex and so on. My belief is that these
writers are working with a popularized understanding of Derrida's deconstruction without fully appreciating the way
that both he and Levinas undermine the idea of privege itself Similarly, Levinas's thought is often summarized in
the slogan "Ethics is First Philosophy". But that's misunderstanding of how cardinal numbers work in Levinas, as we
