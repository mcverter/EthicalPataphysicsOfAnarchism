Too many

Too much of the secondary literature on Levinas is overly pious. Simon Critchley bemoans that
<blockquote>“much of the work on Levinas tends to confine itself to exegesis, commentary, comparison with other
    thinkers, and, at its worst, homage. This is finally dull and produces only discipleship and scholasticism.”
</blockquote>
Samuel Moyn similarly laments
<blockquote>“So much existing commentary on Levinas is offered with submissive piety”.</blockquote>


Samuel moyn wrote and critchley agreed that the too much levinas was too pious
