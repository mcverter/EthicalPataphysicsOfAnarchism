How do we get inside and inhabit the text? Here are some strategies:
OBSERVATIONS of self and text; really paying attention
SURFACING connotations and associations
SOUNDS: repetition, alliteration, assonance
GRAMMAR
COUNTING (tracking verbs, nouns, characters, etc.)
RADICAL NARRATIVE LITERALISM (what’s not here?)
WORDS / ROOTS / DICTIONARIES
RESOURCES: BDB / OED / commentaries
ZOOM IN: details, individual words/spelling, spacing, lineation
ZOOM OUT: research compositional context, layers, authorship, scholarship, debate
SOMATIC RESPONSES to content, meaning, words, sounds, physical pages or screens
