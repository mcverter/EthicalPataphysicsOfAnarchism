* Derrida:  What is influence. We are mystified by the idea of influence ...
* Stories as memories
* Reflected within the totality (quotatoin from text)
* Have a Tomato, Plato (eating?)
* Everybody eats when they come to my house. Eating and Home Chapter
* TENIR MAIN maintain. Subvert Heidegger's usage of the Zuhanden. The action of the hand requires a standing. the
  standing requires a house. the logic of the will and the hand. and the prlace
* Special topics for conversation of the body and the hand, the dimensions, gender, differences between otherwise than
  being, misc
* Height surgir survivre
* kallidescopic
* Periodicity of imaginary numbers and sin/cosine
* Sound waves
* periodicity in quantum waves
* generalization (math? genre? )
* perspective and adumbration
* bring it to husserl
* but also we need to understand better the usage of zero and infinity in projective geometry
* Ethis is an opttics
* Branch of physiccs reflected within totality
* Infinity conditins totality
* So this is projective/perspective geometry
* Begin without recourse to EL's teminonlogy or the tradition emenies of philosophical ????
* WE Not we only then. The third person plural. Uses the we infrequently. To refer to the multiplicity of himself and
  his audience. but not as the social
* Multiplicity zero null
* Include mulitplicity in the numbering.
* Multiplicity is a translation of Reimann manifold
* Clandestine flight before the light
* Negation as il y a
* materialization as massiveness
* upright straightforward euclidiean face to face. droiture. right angles
* droiture and right angles
* consideration of home with respect to eating

* valery. their sounds resonate. etymology
* minkowski space time and relativity
* fourier analysis and quantum mechangics
* seems like a prioitiy of second section over the first but reconsider prioirty. Totality and Infinity is split into
  two sections. THe constrant arguetn is that the second part has proioity of the first section. but reconsider the
  prioirty. the spherical and the hyperbolic geometries.
* trigonometry. the third. triangular. point not on the line. defines a plane i think
* Add Faustroll to sorcere
* Polarity Highest

* Production of Infinity = Birth
* Eating with respect to death etc
* Each Chronological moment is doubled and rotatied transformed.
* DeBroglie waves. Element turns Other. Ionic. Electromagnetic. Magnetic waves. they magnetize the space around them

  comes before the what.
* who and what are both indexicals not nominatives
* "analyss" is a mathematical term
* there is a deeper dimension to Levinas's metaphors of height unrecognized by mots interpretatoins
* height of face curvature

* serialization statistique
* Polar Logic
* continuity and rationality. discontinuity and limits of integrals. of relative peaks
* visage face facade tergiversation
* reciprocal polars
* reason wy political is a mystery for levinas interpretation:  association is welcoming. not about the political per
  se. well in the third book it is whith the third person masculine form. but that is subverted to the feminine.
