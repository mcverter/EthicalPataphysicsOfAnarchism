    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Along with this oversimplification of Levinas's thought often comes a corresponding tendency to multiply obscurity. Rather than taking the time to break a word apart and to analyse the way this word function within Levinas's etymological and sematic constellations, such commentators will instead attempt to explain one cryptic terms with even more cryptic terms -- to explain the idea of substitution by way of persecution by way of amphibology and so forth. In practice, this often simply paraphrasing Levinas or using muddled phrasings and terms that attempt to simulate the well-constructed complexity of Levinas's own text." %}</p>
