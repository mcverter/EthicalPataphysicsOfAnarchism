What impels certain commentators to position themselves as submissive to his higher power? Much of the fault can be attributed to the seductiveness of Levinas's language: if one can manage to wend one's way through the contortions of verbiage, it is hard not to be enchanted by its strange poetry, hypnotised by its rhythm, mesmerized by its an various intensities and extremities." %}</p>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "But, as anyone who has struggled through these texts would know, the reader confronts a serious problem: how can one start to understand these texts that are so seductive yet so difficult to understand?" %}</p>
    <p class="card-text">{% trans "Before we present certain types of tactics that many writers employ, we wish to remark that Levinas's prose is deliberately cryptic. Throughout his analyses of manifold phenomenon, he reiterates the essentially 'hidden' or 'clandestine' aspect of that which is shown: we can know something from the outside as something known to us, but we can never completely know what that thing is from the inside. No matter how much knowledge you accumulate about another person, it's impossible to ever really know what it's like to be that person. This abyss of the unknowable appears throughout philosophical inquiry, always lurking behind notions such as objectivity, materiality, and generality.  An object present its observable sides to us, but in so doing they hide its reverse. Materiality itself presents itself as an obscurity. We can understand matter in its forms and even the formal properties of matter but what matter is in itself has never been entirely clear: it's there but what is it? One can understand a thing through generalities but never its individuality as such. Levinas approaches language in much the same fashion: simultaneously presenting characteristics of an event while explaining that these same characteristics conceal something unpresentable." %}</p>
