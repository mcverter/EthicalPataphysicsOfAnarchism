From the very first, primacy indicates principle and chief. All the classical concepts interrogated by Levinas are thus dragged toward the agora, summoned to justify themselves in an ethico-political language that they have not always sought—or believed that they sought—to speak, summoned to transpose themselves into this language by confessing their violent aims. Yet they already spoke this language in the city, and spoke it well, by means of the detours of philosophy and despite philosophy's apparent disinterest, notwithstanding its eventual return to power" %}</blockquote>

Only the thought of Being can do so, and not traditional 'philosophy' or 'metaphysics'. The latter are therefore 'politics' which can escape ethical violence only by economy: by battling violently against the violences of the an-archy whose possibility, in history, is still the accomplice of archism." %}
