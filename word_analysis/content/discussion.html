Such antagonistic analyses often lead to bellicose declarations, such as Jean-François Lyotard's description of “the hatred of the neutral constantly evinced by Levinas” or the unrelenting violence of RA Cohen who murderously declares that “Levinas cannot live with either Hegel or Derrida” and so on.

But this narrative is laid out as a story of Genesis, borrowing motifs taken from the the Bible and the Greeks and thus tells a coming-of-age story as a series of steps that conform to these patriarchal mythologies. This story describes how one is born into a womb-like or infantile elemental state, oceanic and womblike, then recollects himself as an individual by marrying himself to a woman and positioning himself in a house, from which he performs the activity of labor that produces works and wastes, objects that are alienated from him until he as he ages and deteriorates, drifting drifts off towards a the unfathomable not-yet of death.
