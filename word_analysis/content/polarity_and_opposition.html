Perhaps we can first notice that already the word “opposite” implies the establishment of a position in space and time and also an irreducible positivity. Secondly, we can notice that Levinas's entire phenomenological project entails a description of how thematic elements transform into their opposites: from birth to death to rebirth, from self to other to self, from height to destitution to height." %}</p>
