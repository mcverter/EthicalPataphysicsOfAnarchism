    <p>{% trans "However we must not read these sentences as contradictions of mathmattical analyses.  The fact that hementions them as a virutal though negated possiblity indicates already their importnce in his ecoonmy of analysis.  They are contradicted at very specific points in the analysis and have very specific and contextual meanings wtihtin those contexts." %}</p>

    <p>{% trans "That said, let us ask again: where any why should we thing that Levinas is influenced by mathemeatics.  THe reasons are manifold.  First of all, it is necesary for those of us living in theUnited States and elsewhere to understand that the French have a different relationship to mathematics than we do.  Mathematics is part of french culture -- Galois, Descartes, Fermat, Desargues, Monges, Fourier, Poincare and many others are deeply embedded in French cultural identity.  Levinas himself grew up as a Lithuanian Jew and I do not know whether his exposure to mathematics would have been similar to that of a student at a french lycee.  However, I woudl assume that this education would be equally influenced by the great mathemetical tradition of Russia, whree the greatest mathematician of all time, Leonard Euler, founded the Institute of Mathematics in Saint Petersburg." %}</p>

    <p>{% trans "Brunschvicg was an close collaborator of Bergson, with whom he founded the philosophy periodical 'Les Temps Moderne'.  Levinas questions Brunschvicg's idealist and intuitionst interpretation of mathematical models and instead employs them otherwise." %}</p>

Valéry was often asked to write articles on topics not of his choosing; the resulting intellectual journalism was collected in five volumes titled Variétés." %}</blockquote>
