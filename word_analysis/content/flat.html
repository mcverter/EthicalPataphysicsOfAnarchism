The relation between these two can best be understood as the distinction between curved space and its flat projection. In his second book, however, Levinas reorients this analysis to transform this flat surface into the third dimensionality of the third persons.  In this section, we wil explain the idea of flatness in non-Euclidean geometry, explain how non-Euclidean geometry is employed by the theory of spacetime proposed by Einstein's principle of relativity, and then discuss lines of Totality and Infinity which demonstrate Levinas's usage of these concepts" %}</p>

            <h3 class="card-title">What is Flatness?</h3>
            The notion of flatness emerges out of  non-Euclidean geometry's critique of Euclid's foundational work Geometry in which he sets out five axioms which ground the rest of his straight-edge and compass constructions.  In the 19th century, thinkers such as when Nikolay Lobachevsky, János Bolyai, and Berhnard Riemann developed alternative geometries which violated Euclid's definition of a parallel line and his  fifth axiom. 
            
            Euclid defines a parallel line as follows:
            <blockquote>Parallel straight lines are straight lines which, being in the same plane and being produced indefinitely in both directions, do not meet one another in either direction.</blockquote>
            
            {% static 'images/ParallelLines.png' %}
            
            His fifth axiom asserts:

            <blockquote>If a line segment intersects two straight lines forming two interior angles on the same side that are
                less than two right angles, then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the
                angles sum to less than two right angles.</blockquote>

Each horizontal line is parallel to each other.  The two axes are always at right angles to each other.  You can shift your motion in the current direction one increment in the orthogonal direction by turning counterclockwise, moving one unit in the orthogonal direction and then turning clockwise and resuming your motion.</p>

            <h3 class="card-title">Curvature, Position, and Distance</h3>
            Whereas human interactions require intersections that propel the development of grid-like bureacracies, most if not many of our interactions with the natural world occur in curved environments rather than flat ones. A simple example of this is walking up a hill.
        
            Let's say that you are standing at the bottom a hill, at Level-0 and at Avenue A that goes up the hill.  Your friend Panmuphle is also at the bottom, at Level-0, but he is starting from the opposite side of the hill, at Avenue Z.  To walk to Panmuphle from Level-0, you would have to walk around the base of the hill.  Let's say this distance is 1000 meters.  
            
            Instead of walking around the hill, you and Panmuphle decide to meet each other at the top.  You walk up Avenue A and Panmuphle walks up Avenue Z.  Because the hill is curved and both walking up slopes, the distance that separates you and Panmuphle around the hill decreases as you go upwards.  For example, let's say that when you are at Level-7, for example, the distance separating you if you walked around from Avenue A to Avenue Z is only 800 meters.  Finally, when you both reach the top of the hill, there is effectively 0 meters separating you in the around-direction.
            
            Because of curvature, the relative distance of other objects depends upon one's own position.

            <h3 class="card-title">Gauss Curvature: Theorema Egregium and Relative position</h3>
            The notion of curvature was developed by Gauss when he was studying what properties of spaces remain invariant when you deform them.  He expressed his conclusion af this research as his Theorema Egregium  (Remarkable Theorem)
            <blockquote>If a curved surface is developed upon any other surface whatever, the measure of curvature in each point remains unchanged.
</blockquote>
            That is, you can bend a surface without changing the relative position of the points in the surface.  For example, if you draw a flower on a sheet of paper and then roll that paper into a cylinder, the distance between the points remains the same.  Thus we can say that a cylinder and a sheet of paper have the same curvature, and are both flat.
            
            Conversely, let's draw a smiley face on a sphere.  Is there any way we can unroll that sphere and map it onto a flat sheet of paper such that the relative positions of each point with respect to the others remains the same?
           
            The answer is no.  Their curvatures of a sphere and a flat piece of paper.  
            
            For this reason, it is impossible to perfectly replicate the surface of the Earth on a flat map.  Instead, one must use a variety of techniques to reproduce the maps that distort the areas and distances of the land masses.

As elaborated by Einstein, Poincare, and Minkowski, general Relativity explains how masses, composed of mass and energy, curve the space, time and light. The most simplest illustration of this is the way that mass curves space. If you put a heavy ball in the middle of a sheet, it will bend the sheet around it. By doing so, it creates least-energy pathways around it. In a similar manner, the massiveness of the sun bends the space around it such that planets find the least-action path as elliptical paths around it" %}</p>
