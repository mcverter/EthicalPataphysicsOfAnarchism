In his second book, however, Levinas reorients this analysis to transform this flat surface into the third dimensionality of the third persons.  In this section, we wil explain the idea of flatness in non-Euclidean geometry, explain how non-Euclidean geometry is employed by the theory of spacetime proposed by Einstein's principle of relativity, and then discuss lines of Totality and Infinity which demonstrate Levinas's usage of these concepts" %}</p>
