# Random Notes -- to be sorted 

1. wabi sabi is aesthetic of the 'pataphysical
2. 
   1. But most of the time, we rely on each other, for like everything. For everything we take for granted, like when you let an old lady go in front of you in the checkout line to when you break down on the side of the road and somebody stops to help you out. Most of the time, people help each other out. Most of the time, people help complete strangers out, no matter their race or religion or gender or whatever.
   2. The problem, however, is there are times when people act with malice and deliberately hurt each other. What do we do in those situations? Do we rely on police and the military or do we learn to take care of our communities and of each other?
3. the world as it is, in its fragments is already redeemed.  no need as susan handleman to restore or reunite the fragments.  the secrets of the sabatieanism.  not to restore the shattered lurianic vessel but to preserve it in its fragments.  "Samsara is already nirvana; world is already redeemed."  Check Susan Handelman "Fragments of Redemption" for her reading of Lurianic Tiqqun
4. Barbarianism (incompatibility of speech) vs Babar the elephant.
   1. Incompatibility of speech = violence?
   2. But also the freak is the barbarian
   3. The dangerous stranger at the beginning of Aristotle Politics, man without a state
   4.  ama birch.  Ferguson writings.  I was also trying to figure out why she was reluctant to say it. I mean, she stated why: "People will think i am crazy"  But everyone knows that prophets are tricksters too and often perceived as crazy. But everyone also knows that homeless people as well as queers and freaks and persons of the African diaspora are always put down as "crazy" too. Plus why is being "crazy" a bad thing anyways -- what assumptions are we already making about consciousness and how are we already stigmatizing certain forms of intelligence. Lots and lots of layers to this one
   5.  Barbarian is both the nietzshche's madman or prophet, heidegger is in this mold.  
   6.  derrida does it right with his double reading that shows everything is itself and it opposite
       1.  barbarian as ambiguous outside to language
       2.  violence of language
   7.  Barbarian as ambiguity of violence
   8. Barbar the elephant  Buddhist ears.  Ganesha
   9.  the barbarian is the exception


barbarian (adj.)
mid-14c., "foreign, of another nation or culture," from Medieval Latin barbarinus (see barbarian (n.)). Meaning "of or pertaining to savages, rude, uncivilized" is from 1590s.

barbarian (n.)

early 15c., in reference to classical history, "a non-Roman or non-Greek," earlier barbar (late 14c.) "non-Roman or non-Greek person; non-Christian; person speaking a language different from one's own," from Medieval Latin barbarinus (source of Old French barbarin "Berber, pagan, Saracen, barbarian"), from Latin barbarus "strange, foreign, barbarous," from Greek barbaros "foreign, strange; ignorant," from PIE root *barbar- echoic of unintelligible speech of foreigners (compare Sanskrit barbara- "stammering," also "non-Aryan," Latin balbus "stammering," Czech blblati "to stammer").

Greek barbaroi (plural noun) meant "all that are not Greek," but especially the Medes and Persians; originally it was not entirely pejorative, but its sense became moreso after the Persian wars. The Romans (technically themselves barbaroi) took up the word and applied it to tribes or nations which had no Greek or Roman accomplishments.

Also in Middle English (c. 1400) "native of the Barbary coast;" meaning "rude, wild person" is from 1610s. Occasionally in 19c. English distinguished from savage (n.) as being a step closer to civilization. Sometimes, in reference to Renaissance Italy, "a non-Italian." It also was used to translate the usual Chinese word of contempt for foreigners.

Barbarian applies to whatever pertains to the life of an uncivilized people, without special reference to its moral aspects. Barbarous properly expresses the bad side of barbarian life and character, especially its inhumanity or cruelty: as, a barbarous act. Barbaric expresses the characteristic love of barbarians for adornment, magnificence, noise, etc., but it is not commonly applied to persons: it implies the lack of cultivated taste .... [Century Dictionary, 1889]

to me

I  also write against the terms "indigenous" and "native" from a Levinasian perspective.
These are already terrible words: both "gen" in indigenous and "nat" in native seem to refer to birthright. There is definitely an alternative/Levinasian reading of these terms, but they are most commonly understood as some sort of blood link with the land.
Here is what I wrote before.
====
I strongly dislike this question [of "whose lands are you on"]. The question is based on the idea that the original occupants of a place are its rightful owners, which is in turn based on ideas in English Common Law regarding property ownership. As an anarchist, I refuse to recognize any claim of ownership and any idea of provate property.
If you talk to indigenous folks they do not conceive of their relation to land in terms of ownership; I have never said an indigenous person say "My people belongs here -- your people does not".
In fact, the whole idea of Tribes and Nations as the Sovereign Owners of a land is based on colonialism -- it comes, at least in part, from the Treaties signed with colonial powers. In these treaties, US governments decided to "recognize" a particular subgroup of people living on the land that they could sign a treaty with and thereby bargain away their land.
That is, the idea of tribal possession is actually founded on a strategy of dispossession of colonial powers

9.  The fantasy of “Ego Death”, Atman=Brahman, etc is Authoritarian. It is the void around which the fascist imaginary spins
No. It isn’t. It is a fascist liberation. One has to first understand how fascism is experienced as a liberation. But a liberation to what? If it is a liberation unto the Absolute or the Void, then it is probably fascist Vincent De
It isn’t the technolocratic manipulation: the fantasy of Absolute and Void are always/already fascist. They reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of Emptiness. I blame Schopenhauer for this duck up. Acácia Xylária
Acácia Xylária like Lin Chi hits his students with a stick? But remember the commentary of Pu Hua: HEEHAW HEEHAW!!!
Pu Hua is OG 'pataphysician
However I associate the term “dharma” most closely with the Bhavad Gita, which is mos def mos def a favorite text for fascists. Peter Golightly
Callum Milburn My argument, though, is that the fantasy of yogic unity proposed by the Bhavad Gita, the Yogacaras and the Upanishads is always/already authoritarian.

Callum Milburn strongly dislike nietzsche but respect him greatly. Martin Headgear is a complete putz, though.
The figure of the guru or the all knowing sage is also part of the Authoritarian tradition. It is perhaps the clearest example of literal Authorship. Thanks for the reminder Peter Golightly



10.  Turing AI Responsiblity
11.  Mitchell Verter
"A Levinasian critique of technology would require a meditation on The Turing Test, in which artificial intelligence is assessed by whether a computer’s responses seem human to its interlocutor. In what way does an Other person’s freedom to respond forever transcends the programming of any automated network?"
https://www.waste.org/~roadrunner/writing/Levinas/AnarchismOtherPerson_WEB.htm#_edn40
Mitchell Verter
"[82] Indeed, Levinas’ phenomenology of conversation can be most clearly observed in an internet chat room, in which one party makes a statement, forever etched in memory, but retains the possibility to write something new. At each instant, the interlocutor, the Other detached by millions of miles of fiber optic cable, always retains the freedom to respond in ways that can not be anticipated. Indeed, a Levinasian critique of technology would require a meditation on Alan Turing’s famous test of computer intelligence: in what ways does an Other person’s freedom to respond, capacity to surprise, forever transcend the programming of any automated network.
